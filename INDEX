PC                      Dataset obtained from the polycarbonate test
                        using Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA).

Epoxy                   Dataset obtained from creep tests of an epoxy based
                        composite by using Dynamic
Mechanical Thermal
                        Analysis (DMTA).

SBS                     Dataset obtained from creep tests of styrene-butadiene-styrene
                        (SBS) composite by using
Dynamic Mechanical Thermal
                        Analysis (DMTA).

PLOT.TTS                Time-Temperature Superposition (TTS) plot.

TTS                     The Master Curve at a specific temperature is
                        estimated using Time-Temperature Superposition
                        (TTS) procedures.

TTS_10                  This function provides an estimate of the Master
                        Curve in a similar way to
the TTS function.
